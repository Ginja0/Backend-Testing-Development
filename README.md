How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best way to ensure that a code, program, or software is functional and secure is testing it. Testing the software prevents errors when the software is deployed. Having errors in software that is not functional loses clients and end users. If it is not secure it can be dangerous for the company running the software and the users that use it. Making sure that everything is safe and functional is the job of the software developers. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret the user needs I must first obtain them. I ask them what they are looking for in a program and have them compare it to similar programs. What do the like about the program, what do they need the program to do. Any limits on certain things the software should do. Some limits I will put into place to proactive without the need of the client deciding. For example when designing a variable for a first name, to save on memory I would limit the characters and make sure that it does not accept null entries. These are basic things to make sure the software works and recieves the data that is requiered.  


How do I approach designing software?

I approach software designing trying to put myselft in the position of the client and the end user. I think of what they need and what they would want to do with the software. Of common errors that could happen and the error messages that would be needed for the end user to understand what went wrong when they are using it. I make sure safety is priority as well as functional and efficient code.
